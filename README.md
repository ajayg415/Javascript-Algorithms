###### 1. Write an algoritm for the below problem statement.

```
 There are 8 houses in a row. Some houses are empty and some are not, it will be represented with 1 and 0. 
 
 On Day 1 letâ€™s say first 3 houses are active so it will be represented like [1 1 1], 
 
 On day 2
 - For 1st house, his neighbors are empty (0) and active (1) on previous day so he will be active (1), 
 - For 2nd house, both neighbors are active (1) on previous day so he will be passive (0)
 - For 3rd house, his neighbors are active (1) and empty (0) on previous day, so he will be active (1). 
 
 So day 2 status for first 3 houses will be [1 0 1].  
 
Example:
Sample Input:  [1 0 1 1 0 0  1 0]
Sample Day 1 Output -> [1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0]
Sample Day 2 Output -> [0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1]
Sample Day 3 Output -> [0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0]
Sample Day 4 Output -> [1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0]
Sample Day 5 Output -> [1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1]

Now, write an algorithm to find out the status of each house on any given day. 
Example: findStatus([1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0], 5)

```

```
 const findStatus = (arr, day) =>{
  return (day === 1) ? arr : findStatus(checkStatus(arr), day-1);
 };
 
 const checkStatus = arr => {
  return arr.reduce((a,c,i)=>{
    return (arr[i-1] === arr[i+1]) ? [...a, 0] : [...a, 1]
  },[]) 
 };
 
 findStatus([1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0], 5)
```
